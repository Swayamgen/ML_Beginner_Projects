# Project Title: Predicting Student Scores Based on Study Hours Using Linear Regression
## Project Description:
This project aims to predict a student's score based on the number of hours they study per day using a simple linear regression model. Linear regression is a basic yet powerful statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, the independent variable is the number of hours studied, and the dependent variable is the student's score.

## Objectives:
Data Understanding: Analyze the relationship between study hours and exam scores by visualizing the data.
Model Creation: Develop a simple linear regression model that can accurately predict a student's score based on the hours they study.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the score for a student who studies 9.25 hours per day.
Visualization: Plot the data and the regression line to visually assess the fit of the model.

## Data:
The dataset used in this project contains two variables:
Hours Studied: The number of hours a student spends studying per day.
Scores: The score a student achieves in the exam.

## Steps:
Data Preparation: Convert the raw data into a structured format using pandas.
Variable Definition: Identify Hours as the independent variable (X) and Scores as the dependent variable (y).
Model Training: Create and train a linear regression model using the provided data.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the score for a specific number of study hours (9.25 hours/day).
Visualization: Plot the actual data points and the regression line to evaluate the model's performance visually.

## Conclusion:
The project demonstrates how a simple linear regression model can be used to predict outcomes (scores) based on input data (study hours). The model's prediction for a student who studies 9.25 hours per day is approximately 92.91, indicating a strong positive relationship between the number of study hours and the expected exam score.
